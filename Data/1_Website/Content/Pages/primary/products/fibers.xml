<p>Our company manufactures food grade and non-food grade bleached and unbleached specialty pulp mainly from abaca fiber. Abaca fiber, known worldwide as Manila hemp, is obtained from the leafsheath of the abaca plant, Musa textilis Nee, and it is primarily grown in the Philippines whose warm, wet climate and volcanic soils are particularly suited to its cultivation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cellulose of abaca fiber is considered as the strongest, longest, and most porous among the natural fibers. Laboratory tests show that abaca pulp contains fibers that are four times longer than conifer wood pulp. It is preferred by manufacturers over other fiber sources because its fibers are longer, the percentage of long fiber content is higher, and it is very porous. The current growing concern for environment protection, forest conservation, and the need for environmentally-sustainable products have further enhanced abaca pulp usage over other pulp made from synthetic materials.&nbsp;</p>
